# Password_Generator_App

Password Generator is an app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript code that you will write. Your app will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If youâ€™re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation Links to an external site..][1]
